# pi-open-tui

**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A polished terminal interface for the [Pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent. This is a maintained fork of [OldSuns/pi-open-tui](https://github.com/OldSuns/pi-open-tui) that adds a dedicated cache-hit rate to the footer and turn telemetry.

## Highlights

- **Pi header** with model, thinking level, working directory, and useful slash-command hints
- **Responsive footer** with Git state, detected runtime, context usage, token counts, latest cache-hit rate, cost, and extension status
- **Framed editor** with block, bar, and underline cursor styles
- **Project awareness** for 50+ runtimes and detailed Git states, including ahead/behind, staged, modified, untracked, stashed, and detached HEAD
- **Turn telemetry** for TPS, time to first token (TTFT), duration, stalls, tokens, cache-hit rate, and list-price rate
- **Interactive settings** through `/open-tui`, available in English and Simplified Chinese
- **Version-guarded Pi compatibility shim**: fullscreen wheel speed falls back to Pi's default if its runtime support changes

## Requirements

- Pi 0.80 or later
- A terminal with UTF-8 and color support
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the full icon set (optional; ASCII icons are built in)

## Install

Install the extension:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/pastchais/pi-open-tui
```

Or try it for one session:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/pastchais/pi-open-tui
```

## Font and icons

Download any patched font from the official [Nerd Fonts downloads page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) or [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest). Install it, select that font in your terminal profile, and restart the terminal.

The default `auto` mode detects the terminal environment, not the installed font file. If icons appear as boxes or incorrect symbols, open `/open-tui` and choose one of these modes under **Appearance**:

- `nerd`: force Nerd Font icons after configuring a Nerd Font in the terminal
- `ascii`: use plain-text icons with no patched font required
- `auto`: use Nerd Font icons in recognized terminals and ASCII elsewhere

If the font is installed but `auto` still selects ASCII, choose `nerd` explicitly. In VS Code, Windows Terminal, and similar apps, configure the font in the terminal profile rather than only installing it in the operating system.

## Configuration

Run `/open-tui` to open the settings dialog. It provides **General**, **Appearance**, **Footer**, and **Telemetry** tabs. Settings are stored in `~/.pi/agent/open-tui.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "settingsLanguage": "en",
  "cursorStyle": "block",
  "fullscreen": {
    "wheelScrollLines": 4
  },
  "icons": {
    "mode": "auto"
  },
  "footerSegments": {
    "cwd": true,
    "sessionName": false,
    "gitBranch": true,
    "gitStatus": true,
    "gitCommit": false,
    "runtime": true,
    "context": true,
    "tokens": true,
    "cacheHit": true,
    "cost": true,
    "extensionStatuses": true
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tps": true,
    "ttft": true,
    "duration": true,
    "tokens": true,
    "cacheHit": true,
    "stalls": true,
    "cost": true
  }
}
```

Key options:

| Option | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settingsLanguage` | `en`, `zh` | Changes the `/open-tui` interface language |
| `cursorStyle` | `block`, `bar`, `underline` | `bar` and `underline` require terminal cursor-shape support |
| `fullscreen.wheelScrollLines` | `1`-`10` | Lines scrolled per mouse-wheel notch in fullscreen mode; defaults to `4`. In `/open-tui`, press Enter on this item and type a number (values are clamped to `1`-`10`) |
| `icons.mode` | `auto`, `nerd`, `ascii` | Controls footer and telemetry icons |
| `footerSegments` | Boolean flags | Shows or hides individual footer data |
| `telemetry` | Boolean flags | Enables telemetry and its individual measurements |

`sessionName` appears only when the session has a name. `gitCommit` shows the short hash and tag in detached HEAD state. Disabling `extensionStatuses` hides the entire extension status line, including MCP status.

Fullscreen wheel speed uses an isolated compatibility shim for Pi 0.84.2's runtime field because Pi does not yet expose a public setter. On Pi versions without a compatible field, the setting is ignored and Pi's default scrolling remains active.

## Turn telemetry

After each complete agent run, pi-open-tui shows one transient result. Tool-call turns are combined into that result:

```text
> TPS 42.5 tok/s | ~ TTFT 1.2s | + 29.7s | ↑ 567 | ↓ 1.2k | c CH 88.2% | ! stall 1x / 4.3s | $ $3.60/M
```

TPS is calculated from all provider-reported assistant output tokens divided by the total generation time across the run. Timing starts at `turn_start` and ends at the assistant `message_end`, so it includes TTFT, hidden reasoning, buffering, and stalls; tool execution between turns is excluded. Runs without output tokens or measurable generation time show `TPS —`.

The `$ / M` value is the model's list-price rate from `usage.cost.total`, not the cumulative session cost shown in the footer. Cache-hit rate uses the latest assistant usage (`cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite)`) and is omitted when the provider never reported cache tokens. Footer cache-hit and telemetry cache-hit can be toggled independently from the **Footer** and **Telemetry** tabs.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
pi -e .
```

## Acknowledgements

This project builds on several Pi community packages:

- **[pi-haiku](https://github.com/nnocte/pi-haiku)** — two-line footer structure and working timer
- **[pi-claude-code-tui](https://github.com/Phoobobo/pi-claude-code-tui)** — Pi logo frames and rounded editor border technique
- **[pi-zentui](https://github.com/lmilojevicc/pi-zentui)** — Starship-style footer segments, runtime detection, session lifecycle, and settings UI pattern
- **[pi-tps](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-tps)** — turn timing, stall detection, and conservative TPS measurement

The logo frames are derived from Pi's official install script (`pi.dev/install.sh`). Runtime detection and Git porcelain parsing borrow structure from `pi-zentui`.

Special thanks to the **[LINUX DO](https://linux.do)** community for its support.
